Watch some random YouTube video!

Just a handy static website to generate random google search query for you.

The use of some random google search query is what makes it so fun (it may show some relevant videos depending on your watch history).

## Hidden Options

### `?auto`

If you put `auto` in the URL, it will automatically go to random video on YouTube on current page. Ideal for bookmark URLs

### `?level=2`

A hidden option to choose how random the video will be. Because we query based on some random alphabets in URL, the longer the alphabets the more specific the video will be (and generally less popular). Don't set the value too high, between 2 or 4 is recommended (default is 2)
